    <img src="banana-pudding.jpg">

    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon plus a pinch salt</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>30 to 40 vanilla wafers</li>
        <li>3 to 4 medium ripe bananas</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Separate the yolks from the whites of 3 of the eggs; set aside the whites. Add the remaining whole egg to the yolks.</li>
            <li>In a saucepan, whisk together 1/2 cup sugar, the flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir in the whole egg and 3 yolks, and then stir in the milk. Cook uncovered, stirring often, until the mixture thickens, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of the pudding in a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish. Arrange a layer of vanilla wafers on top of the pudding. Thinly slice the bananas crosswise, about 1/8 inch thick, and arrange a layer of banana slices over the wafers. Spread one-third of the remaining pudding over the bananas and continue layering wafers, bananas and pudding, ending with pudding.</li>
            <li>To make the meringue, beat the reserved egg whites with a pinch of salt until they are stiff. Gradually beat in the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and continue beating until the whites will not slide out of the mixing bowl when it is tilted.</li>
            <li>Spread the meringue over the pudding with a spatula, making a few decorative peaks on top, and bake until the meringue is lightly browned, 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
